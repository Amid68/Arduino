## üìå Projects

### üî¥ **LED Control**

- [**LED Blinking with Serial Communication**](https://github.com/Amid68/LED-Blinking-with-Serial-Communication)  
  A basic "Hello, World!" project in Arduino that demonstrates simple LED blinking with serial communication capabilities.

- [**LED Traffic Light**](https://github.com/Amid68/LED-Traffic-Light)  
  Simulates a traffic light system using multiple LEDs, showcasing sequential control and timing.

- [**Pushbutton Controlled LED**](https://github.com/Amid68/Pushbutton-Controlled-LED)  
  Control an LED using a momentary pushbutton switch, illustrating input handling and digital output control.

- [**Dual-Pin Digital Analog Control**](https://github.com/Amid68/Dual-Pin-Digital-Analog-Control)  
  Demonstrates the use of a single pin in an Arduino Uno to function both as a digital and analog output, optimizing pin usage.

### üéõÔ∏è **Analog Control**

- [**Dimmable LED with Potentiometer**](https://github.com/Amid68/Dimmable-LED-with-Potentiometer)  
  Reads an analog value from pin A5 and converts it into a voltage value between 0 and 5 volts. The voltage is then printed to the serial monitor every 500 milliseconds, allowing for LED dimming based on potentiometer input.

- [**Arduino Bar Graph**](https://github.com/Amid68/arduino-bar-graph)  
  An LED bar graph that can be controlled with a potentiometer, providing a visual representation of analog input values.

### üéÆ **Interactive Projects**

- [**Arduino Piano**](https://github.com/Amid68/arduino-piano)  
  Plays different musical tones when buttons are pressed, simulating a simple piano interface using Arduino.

- [**Arduino Memory Game**](https://github.com/Amid68/arduino-memory-game)  
  An Arduino version of the classic Simon Says memory game, utilizing four LEDs, four pushbutton switches, and a piezo buzzer to test and improve memory skills.

- [**Arduino Electronic Die**](https://github.com/Amid68/arduino-electronic-die)  
  Simulates the rolling of a die using an Arduino Uno R3 and a 7-segment display, implemented in both Arduino Sketch (.ino) and pure embedded C versions.
